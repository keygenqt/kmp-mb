> MVP Done ðŸŽ‰

I set myself a task: to implement a template for future similar projects and do a good deed for [Mobile Broadcast](https://mobilebroadcast.dev). Since this is partly a "template", the project is characterized by reduced coupling of components. There are a lot of different components and features, in the project I collected many of my developments and improved those that were already there. The site turned out to be quite large: 11k lines of JavaScript and 9k lines of Kotlin. It is not perfect, there is still work to do, but this is the path of development.
